                When I was a freshman, I learned python and had a basic knowledge of computer programming. Later, I minied game design and had a certain understanding of C#.And then web design and then javascript
                So I'm not an engineering student but I know something about computer programming.
                Of course, my advantages lie in film production and live TV broadcast. I can independently complete a film with initial scale, and I can be competent for all the positions in a film.I am able to master PS,PR,AU and AE proficiently and apply them in my film production and promotion.Live TV and film production are completely different fields, and live TV focuses more on teamwork.
                I love sports after class, skiing, fitness and swimming are interspersed in my life.I am good at time management and have my own views and analysis on new things. I love and recognize teamwork, and I am confident in my leadership.
